# GreenAndJenksPOS

A proof-of-concept till system designed for a local ice cream shop. The till system had a fully featured GUI with a number of more advanced features, such as the ability to dynamically add new item buttons and change prices. The project makes use of a database to store item data, and uses some more advanced features of VB like generic types.
